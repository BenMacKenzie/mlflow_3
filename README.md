To Do:

1. are traces written to experiment with/without inference talbes enabled?  This is in flight..everything is moving to dedicated servers.
5. illustrate searching traces
6. illustrate versioning of eval table
8. create a setup notebook to create catalogs and schemas
9. add reference for each section.
10. better approach for generating traces.  Use list and search for traces.  when should you use one vs the other?
11. Use better scorers...
12. Where should the system prompt go....shouldn't it be a ChatMessage? rather than added to user question?


take-aways

1. use of traces, evaluate and human feedback works well.
2. new model-centric data model / UI works well.
3. it's pretty complex to author an agent by hand.  determinitic agents seem to be deprecated.    See https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/author-agent
