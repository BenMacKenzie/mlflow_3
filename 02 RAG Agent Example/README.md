## Notes

03_create_agent is just the driver generated from playground.

uses the ReponseAgent Fromat.



### To Do

1. create eval set using traces
2. collect human feedback.
4. set up and explain monitoring (see https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/production-monitoring#archive-traces). [https://e2-demo-field-eng.cloud.databricks.com/explore/data/benmackenzie_catalog/agent_workshop/gisa_agent_payload?o=1444828305810485&activeTab=sample...this comes from inference table.  does not contain full trace.]. It also does not appear in mlflow experiment.   I will now try to enabled scorers and see if it shows up.
